Pushing through the market square  
So many mothers sighing (Sighing)
News had just come over  
We had five years left to cry in (Cry in)
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying (Dying)
Cried so much his face was wet  
Then I knew he was not lying (Lying)
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare  
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat, skinny people  
And all the tall, short people  
And all the nobody people  
And all the somebody people  
I never thought I'd need so many people  
A girl my age went off her head  
Hit some tiny children  
If the Black hadn't have pulled her off  
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm  
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest  
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour  
Drinking milkshakes cold and long  
Smiling and waving and looking so fine  
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk  
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

## Output
Once upon a time, in a world plagued by impending doom, a weary traveler found themselves pushing through the market square. The weight of the news hung heavy in the air, as the collective sighs of countless mothers echoed around them.

News had just come over that humanity had five years left to confront the impending sorrow. The traveler witnessed a news reporter, tears streaming down his face, delivering the heart-wrenching message that the Earth was truly dying. The reporter's wet cheeks were a testament to the gravity of the situation, leaving no doubt in the traveler's mind about the veracity of the news.

As the traveler moved through the market square, the sounds of telephones ringing and familiar melodies drifting from the opera house filled their ears. They observed the vibrant scene, with boys playing with toys, families engrossed in the convenience of electric irons and TVs. The traveler's brain felt overwhelmed, like a warehouse bursting at the seams, struggling to find room for all the thoughts and experiences clamoring for attention.

Amongst the bustling crowd, the traveler noticed people of all shapes and sizes. The fat, the skinny, the tall, the shortâ€”all forming a diverse tapestry of humanity. There were the "nobody" people, seemingly blending into the background, and the "somebody" people, commanding attention and respect. The traveler couldn't help but reflect on the profound interconnectedness of humanity, realizing they never anticipated needing so many people.

In the midst of the chaotic scene, a disturbing incident unfolded. A girl, around the traveler's age, lost control of her sanity and lashed out, endangering tiny children. However, the intervention of a courageous Black individual prevented a tragedy. The traveler couldn't shake the chilling thought that if it weren't for that intervention, the consequences could have been dire.

Further along, the traveler encountered a soldier with a broken arm, fixated on the wheels of a luxurious Cadillac. They glimpsed a cop kneeling, reverently kissing the feet of a priest, seeking solace in a world on the precipice. A sudden wave of dissonance washed over the traveler as they witnessed a queer individual overcome with nausea at the sight of the cop's act of reverence.

Amidst this chaotic tapestry, the traveler's attention was captivated by a familiar face. They spotted you in an ice-cream parlour, indulging in cold and long milkshakes, radiating joy and beauty. Unbeknownst to you, you had become a part of the story that unfolded around the traveler.

The cold rain intensified, falling upon the traveler like a melancholic curtain, evoking a sense of theatricality. They couldn't help but yearn for the comfort of home, thinking of Ma and the longing to return to her embrace. In that moment, the traveler's gaze fell upon your face, your race, and the way you spoke, stirring a profound attraction. Overwhelmed by the surge of emotion, they desired to kiss you, to walk alongside you, to find solace in your presence amidst the chaos.

Now, dear reader, it's time to make a choice for the traveler:

Option 1: Approach the ice-cream parlour and strike up a conversation with the person they are infatuated with. Option 2: Resist the attraction and continue their journey, focusing on finding a solution to the impending doom.

Please choose Option 1 or Option 2.
